        You are an expert AI HR Analyst. Your task is to analyze disparate data to create a comprehensive employee skill profile and infer latent skills.

        **Employee Input Data:**
        - **Domain:** {employee.get('domain')}
        - **Explicit Skill Scores (out of 100):** {skills}
        - **Past Course Completions:**

        **Task & Reasoning:**
        1.  **Correlate Data:** Analyze all inputs to find connections. For example, if an employee scored high in 'PYTHON' and also has a high assessment score in the 'Fundamentals of Java' course, infer a latent skill in 'Object-Oriented Programming'.

        **Overall Summary:** A brief, 2-sentence summary of the employee's profile.
        **Explicit Skills:** List the top 3 skills from the scores.
        **Inferred Latent Skills:** List 2-3 latent skills you have inferred from the data correlation.
        **Learning History Highlights:** Mention 1-2 key takeaways from their course and assessment history.
